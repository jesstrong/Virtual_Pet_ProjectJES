# Virtual Pets  

This is a .NET console app using C#. To run the program, open with Visual Studio. 
User can interact with virtual and “real” pets: 

- An interactive user interface
- Ability for players to enter the game, play as long as they’d like, and leave the game when they want
- Ability for players to enter a name and species for a pet
- Ability for players to see the current status of a pet, such as hunger, boredom, and health
- Ability for players to interact with pet, such as feed, play, and take to doctor
- As players interact with pet, the pet’s status changes
- As "time" ticks by, the pet's status changes negatively

---- 

Our pets are housed in a shelter and cared for by you. You can interact with one pet at a time, or all pets. They can be adopted.

- Ability for players to admit pets into the shelter or adopt them
- Ability for players to see a list of all pets in the shelter
- Ability for players to see the current status of all pets at once, such as hunger, boredom, and health
- Ability for players to choose to interact with one pet or multiple pets, such as feed, play, and take to doctor

Our pets are organic and robotic! They have unique personalities.

- Player’s choice of adding, interacting, or adopting organic or robotic pets
- As players interact with pets, the pet’s status changes differently for organic and robotic pets
- As "time" ticks by, the pet's status changes negatively. The passing of time is measured by how often the player interacts with the program.
